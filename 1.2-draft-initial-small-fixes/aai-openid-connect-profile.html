<p>This specification profiles the OpenID Connect protocol (OIDC) to provide a federated
(multilateral) authentication and authorisation infrastructure for greater
interoperability between Genomics institutions in a manner specifically
applicable to (but not limited to) the sharing of restricted datasets.</p>

<p>In particular, this specification introduces a JSON Web Token
(<a href="#relevant-specifications">JWT</a>) syntax for an access token to
enable an OIDC provider (called a <a href="#term-broker">Broker</a>) to allow a downstream
access token consumer (called a <a href="#term-claim-clearinghouse">Claim Clearinghouse</a>)
to locate the Broker’s /userinfo endpoint as a means to fetch <a href="#term-ga4gh-claim">GA4GH
Claims</a>. This specification is suggested to be used together
with others that specify the syntax and semantics of the GA4GH Claims exchanged.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-notation-and-conventions">Requirements Notation and Conventions</h3>

<p>This specification inherits terminology from the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID
Connect</a> and the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth
2.0 Framework (RFC 6749)</a> specifications.</p>

<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this specification are to
be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>.</p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

<p><a name="term-ga4gh-claim"></a> <strong>GA4GH Claim</strong> – A JWT claim as defined by a GA4GH
documented technical standard that is making use of this AAI specification. Typically
this is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ga4gh_passport_v1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ga4gh_visa_v1</code> claim for GA4GH Passports v1.x.
Note that GA4GH is not the organization making the claim nor taking responsibility
for the claim as this is a reference to a GA4GH documented standard only.</p>

<p><a name="term-claim-management-system"></a> <strong>Claim Management System</strong> – a service
that allows <a href="#term-claim-source">Claim Source</a> users to manage claims and update one
or more <a href="#term-claim-repository">Claim Repositories</a>. For instance, a data owner
of a controlled access dataset would typically interact with a Claim Management
System to add or remove claims from a <a href="#term-claim-repository">Claim Repository</a>.</p>

<p><a name="term-claim-repository"></a> <strong>Claim Repository</strong> – a service that
manages the durable storage and retrieval of claims (such as a database),
along with any metadata and/or audit logs related to claim creation,
modification, and deletion.</p>

<p><a name="term-claim-source"></a> <strong>Claim Source</strong> – the source organization of
a claim assertion which at a minimum includes the organization associated with
asserting the claim, although can optionally identify a sub-organization or a
specific assignment within the organization that made the claim.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is NOT necessarily the organization that stores the claim, nor the
<a href="#term-broker">Broker</a>’s organization that signs the token; it is the
organization that has the authority to assert the claim on behalf of the
user and is responsible for making and maintaining the assertion.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="term-identity-provider"></a> <strong>Identity Provider (IdP)</strong> – a
service that provides to users an identity, authenticates it; and provides
claims to a Broker using standard protocols, such as OpenID Connect, SAML or
other federation protocols. Example: eduGAIN, Google Identity, Facebook, NIH
ERACommons. IdPs MAY be claims sources.</p>

<p><a name="term-broker"></a> <strong>Broker</strong> – An OIDC Provider service that
authenticates a user (potentially by an Identity Provider), collects their
claims from internal and/or upstream claim sources and issues conformant JWT
claims to be consumed by <a href="#term-claim-clearinghouse">Claim Clearinghouses</a>.
Brokers may also be Claim Clearinghouses of other upstream Brokers (i.e.
create a chain of Brokers like in the
<a href="#flow-of-claims">Flow of Claims diagram</a>).</p>

<p><a name="term-claim-clearinghouse"></a> <strong>Claim Clearinghouse</strong> – A consumer
of <a href="#term-ga4gh-claim">GA4GH Claims</a> (i.e. an OIDC Relying Party or a service
downstream), that were provided by a <a href="#term-broker">Broker</a>, to make an
authorization decision at least in part based on inspecting GA4GH claims and
allows access to a specific set of underlying resources in the target
environment or platform. This abstraction allows for a variety of models for
how systems consume these claims in order to provide access to resources.
Access can be granted by either issuing new access tokens for downstream
services (i.e. the Claim Clearinghouse may act like an authorization server)
or by providing access to the underlying resources directly (i.e. the Claim
Clearinghouse may act like a resource server). Some Claim Clearinghouses may
issue access tokens that may contain a new set of GA4GH Claims and/or a
subset of GA4GH claims for downstream consumption.</p>

<p><a name="term-data-holder"></a> <strong>Data Holder</strong> – An organization that
protects a specific set of data. They hold data (or its copy) and respects
and enforces the data owner’s decisions on who can access it. A data owner
can also be a data holder. Data holders run an
<a href="#term-claim-clearinghouse">Claim Clearinghouse Server</a> at a minimum.</p>

<p><a name="term-data-owner"></a> <strong>Data Owner</strong> – An organization that manages
data and, in that role, has capacity to decide who can access it. For
instance, a Data Access Committee (DAC).</p>

<p><a name="term-passport-scoped-access-token"></a> <strong>Passport-Scoped Access
Token</strong> – A JWT bearer token, returned as an OAuth2 access token as
described herein, encoded via JWS Compact Serialization per
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515">RFC7515</a>, containing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ga4gh_passport_v1</code> as a space-separated entry within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scope</code> claim but
does not contain <a href="#term-ga4gh-claim">GA4GH Claims</a>.</p>

<p><a name="term-visa-issuer"></a> <a name="term-embedded-token-issuer"></a>
<strong>Visa Issuer</strong> (aka “Embedded Token Issuer”) – a service that signs
<a href="#term-visa">Visas</a>.</p>

<p><a name="term-visa"></a> <a name="term-embedded-token"></a>
<strong>Visa</strong> (aka “Embedded Token”) – A <a href="#term-ga4gh-claim">GA4GH Claim</a>
value or entry within a list or object of a GA4GH Claim that contains a JWT
encoded via JWS Compact Serialization per
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515">RFC7515</a>.
It MUST be signed by a <a href="#term-visa-issuer">Visa Issuer</a>. A Visa MAY be passed
through various <a href="#term-broker">Brokers</a> as needed while retaining the token
signature of the original Visa Issuer.</p>

<h3 id="relevant-specifications">Relevant Specifications</h3>

<p><a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OIDC Spec</a> -

<h3 id="flow-of-claims">Flow of Claims</h3>

<p><img src="/data-security/1.2-draft-initial-small-fixes/AAI/claim_flow_of_data_basic.svg" alt="FlowOfClaims"></p>

<p>The above diagram shows how claims flow from a <a href="#term-claim-source">Claim
Source</a> to a <a href="#term-claim-clearinghouse">Claim
Clearinghouse</a> that uses them. This does not
label all of the Relying Party relationships along this chain, where
each recipient in the chain is typically – but not always – the
relying party of the auth flow that fetches the claims from upstream.</p>

<p>Implementations may introduce clients, additional services, and protocols –
not detailed in the above diagram – to provide the mechanisms to move the data
between the Claim Repository and the <a href="#term-broker">Broker</a>.
These mechanisms are unspecified by the scope of this specification except that
they MUST adhere to security and privacy best practices, such as those outlined
in this specification, in their handling of protocols, claims, tokens and
related data. The flow between these components (represented by black arrows)
MAY not be direct or conversely services shown as being separate MAY be
combined into one service. For example, some implementations MAY deploy one
service that handles the responsibilities of both the Visa Issuer and
the Broker.</p>

    <p>By signing an access token, an Broker asserts that the GA4GH Claims that
token makes available at the /userinfo endpoint – not including any
Visas – were legitimately derived from their <a href="#term-claim-source">Claim
Sources</a>, and the content is presented and/or

    <p>When a Broker provides Embedded Tokens from other Visa Issuers, it is providing
them “as is” (i.e. it provides no additional assurance as to the quality,
authenticity, or trustworthiness of the claims from such tokens and any such
assurances are made by the issuer of the Visa, i.e. the Visa Issuer).</p>

        <p>Claim Clearinghouses MAY trust more than one Broker</p>

      </li>
    </ol>

<h2 id="token-revocation">Token Revocation</h2>

<h4 id="claim-source-revokes-claim">Claim Source Revokes Claim</h4>

<p>Given that claims can cause downstream access tokens to be minted by Claim
Clearinghouses and such downstream access tokens may have little knowledge or no
connectivity to sources of claims, it can be challenging to build robust
revocation capabilities across highly federated and loosely coupled systems.
During the lifetime of the downstream access token, some systems may require
that claims are no longer inspected nor updated.</p>

<p>In the event that a <a href="#term-claim-source">Claim Source</a> revokes a claim within
a <a href="#term-claim-repository">Claim Repository</a>, downstream Visa
Issuers, Brokers, Claim Clearinghouses, and other Authorization or Resource
Servers MUST at a minimum provide a means to limit the lifespan of any given
access tokens generated as a result of claims. To achieve this goal, servers
involved with access may employ one or more of the following options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Have each GA4GH Claim or sub-object be paired with an expiry timestamp.
Expiry timestamps would require users to log in occasionally via
an Broker in order to refresh claims. On a refresh, expiry timestamps can
be extended from what the previous claim may have indicated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide GA4GH Claims in the form of <a href="#term-visa-access-token">Visa Access
Tokens</a> to allow downstream Claim
Clearinghouses to periodically check the validity of the token via calls
to the /userinfo endpoint as per <a href="#at-polling">Access Token Polling</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide refresh tokens at every level in the system hierarchy and use
short-lived access tokens. This may require all contributing systems to
support <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess">OIDC offline
access</a>
refresh tokens to deal with execution of processes where the user is no
longer actively involved. In the event that refresh tokens experience
errors, the systems involved must eventually revoke the ability for
downstream access tokens to be replaced via refresh tokens (although some
level of delay to reach out to a user to try to resolve the issue may be
desirable).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide some other means for downstream Claim Clearinghouses or other
systems that create downstream access tokens to be informed of a material
change in upstream claims such that action can be taken to revoke the token,
revoke the refresh token, or revoke the access privileges associated with
such tokens.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="revoking-access-from-bad-actors">Revoking Access from Bad Actors</h4>

<p>In the event that a system or user detects that a specific user is misbehaving or
has falsified claims despite previous assurances that access was appropriate,
there MUST be a mechanism to withdrawal access from existing tokens and update
claims to prevent further tokens from being minted.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Systems MUST have a means to revoke existing refresh tokens or remove
permissions from access tokens that are sufficiently long-lived enough to
warrant taking action.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If an access token is long-lived, then the access token MUST be
revocable, and once revoked the /userinfo endpoint MUST NOT return
claims. In this event, an appropriate error status MUST be returned as per
<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError">section 5.3.3 of the OIDC specification</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="#at-polling">Access Token Polling</a> can allow downstream systems to detect
token revocation and remove access accordingly.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h4 id="limited-damage-of-leaked-tokens">Limited Damage of Leaked Tokens</h4>

<p>In order to limit damage of leaked tokens, systems MUST provide all of the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be able to leverage mechanisms in place for revoking claims and tokens
for other purposes to also limit exposure of leaked tokens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow best practices for the safekeeping of refresh tokens or longer lived
tokens (should longer lived tokens be needed).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limit the life of refresh tokens or long-lived keys before an auth challenge
occurs or otherwise the refresh token simply fails to generate more access
tokens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any signed tokens that may be stored by participating services SHOULD be
encrypted at rest and follow best practices to limit the ability of
administrators from decrypting this content.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
