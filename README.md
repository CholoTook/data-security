# data-security

This is the repository for the source of any specifications/documentation
of the GA4GH Data Security working group.

The source is written in Markdown and processed via Jekyll.

To produce a local copy, you can

```shell
make
```

or alternatively run the simple `docker` command shown in the Makefile (runs Jekyll in `serve` mode).

The local copy can then be browsed at

```
http://localhost:4000/local/
```
