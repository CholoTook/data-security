## Updating the specifications

Minor editorial fixes where there is no likelihood of controversy may be done directly on the **master** branch.
Larger changes should be proposed as pull requests so that they can be discussed and refined.
This way when the main repository is forked again, the new fork is created with a minimum of extraneous volatile branches.)
